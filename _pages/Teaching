In the classroom, I am interested in using a humanities framework to build community and help students develop personalized ethical frameworks for engaging with AI and emerging technologies, drawing from critical AI studies to examine their broader societal implications across labor, environment, data privacy, and creative ownership. My teaching philosophy centers on guiding students to examine how AI practices intersect with humanistic values while fostering critical thinking about both immediate and long-term societal impacts of artificial intelligence.

Currently at Kennesaw State University, I teach graduate courses in the AI Writing Technologies certificate program, including ***Writing with AI***, which guides students in developing personalized ethical frameworks for AI integration across creative, applied, and research writing contexts. I also teach creative writing workshops that develop students' artistic voices and critical thinking skills.

With experience teaching at the University of Michigan, Grand Valley State University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of California Irvine, I've developed a versatile teaching approach that adapts to diverse student populations and institutional contexts. My teaching experience spans Poetry, Screenwriting, Fiction, Digital Humanities, and Composition—allowing me to guide students across various forms of expression and academic discourse while helping them navigate the evolving landscape of AI-augmented writing practices.

My courses emphasize hands-on experimentation with cutting-edge AI tools alongside critical examination of their societal implications, ensuring students remain thoughtful practitioners who can participate meaningfully in conversations about responsible technology integration across disciplines.
