I am a poet, AI ethics researcher, and educator currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the English Department – AI Writing at Kennesaw State University (Fall 2025).

I completed my PhD in Creative Writing and Literature at the University of Cincinnati (2025), where I worked at [The Digital Scholarship Center](https://libraries.uc.edu/digital-scholarship.html), [*The Cincinnati Review*](https://www.cincinnatireview.com/), and [Acre Books](https://acre-books.com/), and studied ethical AI through digital humanities. I am also a graduate of the MFA program in Creative Writing at the University of California, Irvine (2021).

My research explores the intersection of creative writing, artificial intelligence, and digital humanities. I developed the Single-Authorship-Mega-Prompting-Method (SAMPM), a framework that re-humanizes AI in creative writing by illuminating the inherently human elements throughout the creation, dataset compilation, and curation processes. My creative dissertation, *Our Sun Bear Paws*, demonstrates this methodology through a poetic dialogue between human and AI-generated voices.

As a poet, my work has appeared in *Poetry*, *Prairie Schooner*, *The Cincinnati Review*, *Copper Nickel*, and *Pleiades*, among others. My chapbook [*"American" Home*](https://www.autumnhouse.org/books/american-home/) (Autumn House Press, 2021) won the AHP Chapbook Contest and was featured on *The Slowdown* hosted by Ada Limón and *The Chapbook* podcast by Bull City Press.

In my teaching, I use humanities frameworks to build community and help students better understand the world through the intersections of literature and digital technology. At Kennesaw State, I’ll be teaching a graduate seminar examining Artificial Intelligence through a humanistic lens alongside creative writing workshops.

I currently serve as Editor in Chief of [*The Account: A Journal of Poetry, Prose, and Thought*](https://theaccountmagazine.com) and Poetry Editor at *Overhead Lit*. My editorial approach captures the contemporary breadth of literary works, viewing them as both ongoing conversations and time capsules that preserve the expressive history of our moment.

Through both my creative and scholarly work, I aim to develop approaches that allow human and artificial intelligence to collaborate meaningfully while maintaining the human elements that make creative expression valuable.
